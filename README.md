# jca-test-suite

## Overview
A project for testing the correctness and performance of the EPICS CA software for Java.  In particular the [epics2web](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/epics2web) service is tested against clients configured to directly query a gateway via either [CAJ](https://github.com/epics-base/caj) or the newer Java 8 [CA](https://github.com/channelaccess/ca) library.
